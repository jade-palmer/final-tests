The windows from across the street are also visible, including an outdoor \"JETHRO\" sign. People frequently pass in front of the camera.

Enfin, c'est l'essai de comprendre l'histoire, peut-etre, de \"le mot dit,\" de l'origine. On commence avec deux raconteurs traditionnels. We've got a couple of traditional storytellers and, in the second half of the evening, we have the Groupe de Poesie Moderne to do something amazing with language and, I think it's safe to say, something representative of more or less the contemporary and... And I'd suggest... (?) did you ever think of the \"Groupe de Poesie Post-Moderne\"? Anyway, (all the way from?) the traditional (brand?) and, two varieties, two different languages represented: Njacko Backo, who'll be up presently, is a storyteller and musician who comes from Cameroon, un conteur traditionnel camerounais; and Trevor Ferrier, who will open the night's entertainments... he uses African percussion. And I think we'll all appreciate perhaps the contrast between a tradition of storytelling wherein the performer is basically the only vehicle for that tradition and, the other end of the spectrum, the Groupe de Poesie Moderne, a little later on. So, without a whole lot more chatter, I'm going to introduce Trevor Ferrier to you. Bon, faites comme vous voulez, c'est chez toi, chez vous, ce soir. I should mention that every coffee and beer sold goes a little way to helping the series continue, and I'll leave it at that. Trevor, if we may, please. Trevor Ferrier. [Applause]. | Video Description: Cut to a medium closeup of Lee Gotham making introductory remarks at the mic. Gotham wears a grey button-down shirt with sleeves a bit rolled up and tucked into jeans, black leather belt, full beard, and long hair tied in a ponytail. Different degrees of closeup as Gotham makes introductory remarks, often gently scratching the corner of his right eye."
