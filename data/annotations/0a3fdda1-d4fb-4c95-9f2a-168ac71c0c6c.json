A single mic stand. The stage, slightly below street level, is set against a full-wall window looking out onto the St. Laurent Blvd. traffic---with both pedestrians and vehicles regularly passing by. The windows from across the street (4067 St. Laurent) are also visible. Several big spheric lamps hanging over the stage and draped orange curtains almost entirely raised, covering little of the windows. Against the windows, a vertical rectangular banner with the name \"ga press / MONTREAL,\" as well as a series of smaller separate posters with numbers on them: 86, 99, 116, and 235."
