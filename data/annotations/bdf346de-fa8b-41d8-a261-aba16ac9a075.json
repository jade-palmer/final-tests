Two people enter the stage from stage right. Camera pans toward the right, where another set of performers is seen running and walking into the stage area. Members of the Fluffy Pagan Echoes move around the stage, each doing different actions, such as stomping, speaking into different microphones, or examining different parts of the stage. They assemble downstage centre, moving microphones closer to centre stage. Camera zooms into a medium closeup on Victoria Stanton. Stanton wears a black vest over a long-sleeved grey shrt and shoulder-length brown hair. The camera pans right to capture each Fluffy Pagan Echoes member. Ran Elfassy wears a white graphic t-shirt, green shorts over white pants, a necklace, and black toque. Vincent 'Vince' Tinguely wears a white graphic t-shirt, jeans, chin-length white hair, and glasses. Scott Duncan wears a flannel shirt and short curly brown hair. Justin McGrail wears a yellow patterned shirt over graphic t-shirt, short brown hair, and necklaces.
