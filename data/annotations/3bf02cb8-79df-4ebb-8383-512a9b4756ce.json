We've got a couple of traditional storytellers and, in the second half of the evening, we have the Groupe de Poesie Moderne to do something amazing with language and, I think it's safe to say, something representative of more or less the contemporary and... And I'd suggest... (?) did you ever think of the \"Groupe de Poesie Post-Moderne\"? Anyway, (all the way from?) the traditional (brand?) and, two varieties, two different languages represented: Njacko Backo, who'll be up presently, is a storyteller and musician who comes from Cameroon, un conteur traditionnel camerounais; and Trevor Ferrier, who will open the night's entertainments... he uses African percussion. And I think we'll all appreciate perhaps the contrast between a tradition of storytelling wherein the performer is basically the only vehicle for that tradition and, the other end of the spectrum, the Groupe de Poesie Moderne, a little later on. So, without a whole lot more chatter, I'm going to introduce Trevor Ferrier to you. Bon, faites comme vous voulez, c'est chez toi, chez vous, ce soir. I should mention that every coffee and beer sold goes a little way to helping the series continue, and I'll leave it at that. Trevor, if we may, please. Trevor Ferrier.

I would like to know that everyone is comfortable, as we have a real treat (?). We have, this evening, a cabaret of poetry. And the participants---and your performers---are Endre Farkas and Suzanne Nuttall. Endre Farkas started creating sound-text-movement poetry-performance pieces in the late 70s, before the spoken word was a glint in anyone's imagination. Endre worked with collaborators from different disciplines across Canada. He's also published seven books of poetry. His most recent book is Surviving Words (The Muses' Company, 1994) and is available along with the Bare Bones cassette (En Guard Records, 1994), pertaining to Suzanne Nuttall, who is one half of Bare Bones. They've just returned from a successful tour out West and in the Yukon. They've two cassettes and a CD to their credit. I think I see both CDs and cassettes, is that right (?), in your corner. Just on your way out, or on your way in, you can have a look at this stuff, because they're beautiful offerings. So, Bare's most recent CD-cassette is called Elusive and is available here this evening. So, both Surviving Words and Elusive---anytime, during the evening, you might wanna choose the intermission, but anytime, (on your left just before the?) door. And now, welcome to the cabaret!
