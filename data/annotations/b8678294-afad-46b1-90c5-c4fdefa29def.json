Mic feedback noise, with Lee Gotham humming to the same pitch.] Good evening one and all and thanks once again for coming out to another evening of Enough Said. Just a short (?) of things underway this evening, a couple of items of interest, in the very near future. I have the grand pleasure of presenting this (one?): Adeena Karasick, this next Monday. Adeena is a performance poet, language-centred writing, tender concerns front and centre, and is a wonderful act; she has toured all over the world, read with everyone from Ginsberg and Creeley to Nichols (?). It's a wonderful pleasure to present her. The week after, this is another pet project of mine, that I've only plugged very discreetly up until now, but it's called Pawn, and it's a cultural magazine that it's growing out of a pretty eclectic literary bag, that we managed to get together as a bunch of undergrad students at Concordia two or three years back. Still literature as an undeniable emphasis, and a real strong lineup, and I'm not gonna talk anything about any of the people (involved?). We will be launching this magazine, and some of those people involved will be here, not next Monday but the Monday after. So, that's a couple of items in the near future. In the nearest future, I have the equal pleasure in presenting this evening two very interesting acts: the first of them the Phineas Flower Trio. | Video Description: Medium long shot of the stage then zoom into different degrees of closeup as the camera adjusts frame and focus.
