Thank you very much. And, if you need a smoke, yeah, right back to the bar or maybe out to the foyer would be just as good in-between acts or something of that nature. Ok, well, it's going to be an eventful evening. I don't need to do any introductions, I'm told, it's wonderful. I could just mention that-at another point in the evening I will tell you all about what's happening come February and March. And, yeah, without further ado, we're gonna forge straight into things. So, enjoy, yeah, for those who haven't overcome the oral phase, bare with us [laughter] until (it?) breaks, ok? | Video Description: Camera zooms into a medium closeup as Lee Gotham adjusts the mic.
