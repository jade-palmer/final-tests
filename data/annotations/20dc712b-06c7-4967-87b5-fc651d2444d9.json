Nothing auspicious in that, but in the performers being presented this evening I have nothing but unbounded enthusiasm and pleasure in presenting both our lead-off readers, Sonja Skarstedt, the author of Mythographies (Empyreal Press, 1990), a volume of her poetry put out [Gotham hiccups] not only through sheer will and talent and ingenuity on her own small press Empyreal, but this evening reading to us from a collection of short stories in the works---and we will all anticipate that publication in the nearest possible futures. Sonja will lead off, as I say. We have a second feature performer in Lynn Suderman, whom I will describe, I hope, with some articulation, a little bit later. But, as we will have the open-mic segment most likely deferred to the end of the evening, perhaps one segment in-between the two performers if that list grows any longer. Yeah, I'll just encourage everybody to get themselves comfortable and keep themselves refreshed. A little bit out of every coffee and beer sold goes to keeping this little series running. And... jee!... enjoy the evening's offerings. Sonja Skarstedt, can you kick us off please? | Video Description: Extreme closeup of Lee Gotham on stage, then zoom out, with the camera alternating between a medium shot and various degrees of closeup. Gotham wears a black turtleneck, stud earrings on the left lobe, hair tied under a black skullcap with a folded visor, and a beard. Gotham makes introductory remarks, often scratching his right eye.
